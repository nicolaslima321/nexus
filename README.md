# Nexus

## Overview

**Nexus** is a resilient network, also known as the "Survival Nexus." This system serves as a critical lifeline, enabling the remaining humans to detect new infections, coordinate resources, and improve their chances of surviving this unprecedented crisis.

---

## Technologies

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **NestJS**
- **Next.js**
- **TailwindCSS**
- **TypeScript**
- **TypeORM**
- **Docker**
- **Docker Compose**
- **PostgreSQL**

---

## Setup

The project is fully dockerized, and it's recommended to set it up using **Docker**. To do so, ensure **Docker** and **Docker Compose** are installed on your operating system.

---

## Environment Variables

Before running the project, you need to set up the environment variables:

1. Copy the **.env.example** file into a new file called **.env**, located in both the **backend** and **frontend** root folders.
2. To simplify this process, you can execute the shell script [**setupEnvs.sh**](./setupEnvs.sh) in the root directory.

Docker will automatically inject these variables into the containers.

---

## Install & Build

Once the containers are started with Docker, the following will occur automatically:

- Both the **frontend** and **backend** applications will be installed using `yarn`.
- The **PostgreSQL** database will be created and configured.
- Database tables will be generated by the **NestJS** backend, including seeded data for usage.

To start the containers, run:
```bash
docker compose up
```

To run the process in detached mode, execute:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

By default, the apps will be available at:
- Backend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Frontend: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

There's an first "admin" survivor generated when the app starts up for the first time, that can be used for login on the system:
- **E-mail**: admin@nexus.com
- **Password**: admin

---

## Logs, Watchers, and More

- If you detached the terminal, view the backend logs by running:
  ```bash
  docker compose logs -f backend
  ```

- Similarly, for the frontend logs:
  ```bash
  docker compose logs -f frontend
  ```

- To access a container terminal, for tasks such as running tests (see Developer Notes), use:
  ```bash
  docker compose exec <service-name> bash
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  docker exec -it <service-name> bash
  ```

---

## Features

- **Survivor Management**:
  - Creation and management of survivors and their inventories.
  - Resource tracking (consumed and available).
  - Health monitoring for survivors.
  - Authentication system using JWT.
  - API key protection for sensitive endpoints.

---

## Developer Notes

- The UI uses a few **Material-UI (MUI)** components for convenience, but most components were built with **React** and **TailwindCSS**.
- Inventory exchanges consider the **logged-in survivor** as the requester.
- Survivors can be created via the `/survivor` page on the frontend. However, to log in, they must sign up for an account via the signup page.
  - **Note**: Creating a survivor in the admin panel does not automatically create an account. This could be an area for improvement.

#### Testing
- Unfortunately, I couldn’t implement unit tests and E2E tests due to time constraints. These are among the main improvements I’d prioritize:
    - Frontend E2E: Cypress.
    - Backend E2E: Nest testing library (built on Jest).
    - Unit Tests: Jest for both frontend and backend.

- I also started implementing OAuth with GitHub, but due to time constraints, I focused on completing the regular login functionality.
